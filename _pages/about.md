I'm Yosuke Ueno, a postdoc researcher (JSPS PD) of [Nakamura-Takase Lab](http://www.hal.ipc.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/) at the University of Tokyo ([Graduate School of Information Science and Technology](https://www.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index_e.shtml)).
I'm a visiting researcher of [Kondo-Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/kondo-lab/kondo?authuser=0) at Keio University. I'm also a visiting assistant professor at [System LSI Research Center](https://slrc.kyushu-u.ac.jp/en/), Kyushu University.
